# Workflow, year 2- 



Workflow was a project that spanned our summer months.
It was our first introduction to Unit testing and E2E testing- 
We were provided a repo to pull on which we were to perform said tests via ESlint, Jest and Cypress.




Our Brief:

    
    Although Quality Assurance is a practice we should be concerned with throughout the development cycle, it is common to sprint towards an MVP version of an application before later improving the quality. In this exercise you are tasked with improving the quality of an existing application by providing various development workflows as well as a testing strategy.

    There are two ways to complete this assignment:

    Teams of two developers, working on each other’s applications
    Solo developers, working on the provided application
    The existing application package must feature:

    A front-end login form connected to an API JWT endpoint
    A front-end logout button connected to browser storage
    Front-end CRUD functionality for at least one object type
    A front-end profile page
    The Noroff API Social Media client works well with this exercise.
    User can react to a post content item`





## Important notes- 

    
    Test Failure: In some cases, a well written test will still fail if the project does not meet the expectations. For example, the project may not show user error messages. In      this case the test case The user cannot submit the login form with invalid credentials and is shown a message. should fail. Writing tests that always pass is not the purpose       of this assignment.

    Issues: While working on another project you may encounter bugs or issues with this project. If a test is failing, create a new Issue to contact the project owner. If you         wish to offer a fix for this bug, please do so in a separate Pull Request, for example from the branch worfklow-fixes.

    Process
    Find a partner to work with or select the example repository.
    Fork the project repository to your GitHub account.
    Create a new branch called workflow.
    Configure the project with eslint, prettier and commit hooks.
    Configure the project with GitHub Actions for build/deploy if required.
    Record any bugs found during this process in the Issues tab.
    Configure the project for Jest and Cypress.
    Create tests to cover the required test cases.
    Create a Pull Request from workflow into the default branch.
    Request a review from your peers to help improve your submission.
    Make any final changes based on this feedback.
    Submit a link to the Open Pull Request on Moodle.







## Site purpose:


** Important **

Though the site purpose does as it should in regards to practicality- our main objective is to ensure that our testing ran smoothly.
Because of this we made no changes to the already available code- merely installed the neccessary dependencies and test script.

## Configuration Information

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run the following commands:

- **`npm start`**: Starts the development server with live reloading. This runs `sass` in watch mode and serves the files using `live-server`.

- **`npm run build`**: Compiles the SCSS files to CSS and outputs them to the `dist/css` directory.

- **`npm run format`**: Formats all files in the project using Prettier to ensure consistent code style.

- **`npm run cypress:open`**: Opens the Cypress end-to-end test runner for interactive testing.

- **`npm run cypress:run`**: Runs the Cypress end-to-end tests in headless mode, typically used in CI pipelines.

- **`npm test`**: Runs the Jest unit tests.

- **`npm run test:jest`**: Runs Jest in watch mode, re-running tests on file changes.

- **`npm run prepare`**: Installs Husky Git hooks. This is automatically run by Git hooks.

### Linting and Formatting

- **ESLint**: To lint your JavaScript files and automatically fix problems, run:
  ```bash
  npm run lint


**note**
To format all files according to Prettier’s rules, run:
    npm run format
