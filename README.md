# JavaScript 2, year 2- 

This was our first project in the first year of our Studies-
This was initially our introduction into design and CSS, then an exercise in stretching our JavaScript skills.
The main purpose of this site was to advertise and sell games at competitive prices, to be able to view them and their specific details and to add them to your cart.


Our Brief:

    To complete the required features, you will also need to make use of GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE HTTP methods.

    You must use JSDocs to document at least one function. The minimum requirement is one example of well written JSDocs for a function that includes argument types, return types, a description and a usage example. If you have remaining time before delivery, you should use this to document all of your remaining functions.

    Using localStorage is highly recommended, especially for storing JWT tokens.

    A finished project fulfils the requirements below with an easy to use and error-free user interface.

    Required features

    The following user stories are required for a passing submission:

    User with @noroff.no or @stud.noroff.no email can register profile
    Registered user can login
    User can view a post content feed
    User can filter the post content feed
    User can search the post content feed
    User can view a post content item by ID
    User can create a post content item
    User can update a post content item
    User can delete a post content item
    Additional features

    The following user stories are optional:

    User can create a comment on a post
    User can edit profile media
    User can follow/unfollow a profile
    User can react to a post content item`





## Workflow and "To Do" list- 

    Create or select one repository to use throughout this project.
    Create a js2 branch from the default master or main branch.
    You may use either Trello or GitHub Projects to manage your development tasks. If you are using Trello, please make sure that your board is public and that a link is provided in your readme.md file. Make sure to detail tasks accurately and divide them evenly if working a group.

    Examples of detailed & accurate tasks (My tasks added as completed) see an "X" next to each completed task:


    Create new repository for work,
    Undo bootstrap stylings (I did not like the finstionality)
    create new forms and style them
    Fix file structure (I did this THREE TIMES!)
    Create Login forms
    create register forms
    Style login and register forms- 
    Add default functionality

    Add 



    Yet to:
    


    Create search form HTML
    Search form SCSS styling
    Filter posts function
    Implement search event listener
    Review the API Documentation and API Swagger.
    Plan your approach, desired features and work strategy.
    Implement the required features as per your work plan.


    ---Review 2 of your peers projects. (4 per team)

    Open a Pull Request from js2 into the default branch.



## Site purpose:


** Important **

I should first point out that the sign in and sign up pages have the same styles, so they will be found in the "sharedResources" folder.
The same goes for the general styles in the feed and profile page, so these have also been placed in "sharedResources"-- I did this to avoid duplicate code, and hope it makes sense. If not in the folder corresponding to the page you seek, then you will find the code in shared resources.


Social Media site that the user should be able to register to, log into, post onto-  they should be able to make a profile, edit and remove posts.


### Description

-- Login/ register

Should be able to register, first and foremost- this will create a profile for the user.
Login should be able to do similar, but with a previously registered email and name etc.



 

-- Profile--

The most interactive of the pages on this relatively simple site- here the user should be able to post a "thought", edit the thought they posted, remove it, sort the other posts on the page- 




-- Profile page

Should display the information that the user has put on their register form, should display the posts they have made.

** Note **

No Tech used so far- Pure CSS, HTML, and JavaScript- will update if this changes
